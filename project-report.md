# Summary
The following report explains the rationale for the design and implementation of 
the Health and Fitness Club Management System.
It is divided into six sections as described in the project specifications.

# Conceptual Design
Explain the conceptual design of the database: 
the ER-diagram for the Health and Fitness Club, and
assumptions made regarding cardinalities and participation types.
Ensure that assumptions align with the problem statement in Section 1.

<a id="relation-schemas"></a>
# Reduction to Relation Schemas
Consolidate your ER-diagram into relational schemas using the most effective method
for mapping ER components to table.

<a id="ddl"></a>
# DDL File
Transform your Relational Database Schema into a data definition language (DDL) statements file with a `.sql` extension.
By executing this file on PostgreSQL, your database should be successfully created.
Ensure to define the constraints (other than primary keys and foreign keys that are already included in the Schema).

<a id="dml"></a>
# DML File
Provide a data manipulation language (DML) file, with a `.sql` extension, containing sample data for each table.
This data will be utilized to demonstrate your application.

<a id="implementation"></a>
# Implementation
Your application can assume the form of a Command-Line Interface, a Web application, or a Desktop-based application.
Please describe your application's architecture, ensuring the utilization of a relational database.
You can employ any programming language to implement your application.

# GitHub Repository
Upload your source code to a public GitHub repository.
Include a comprehensive README and a directory titled `SQL` with ddl and dml files.
