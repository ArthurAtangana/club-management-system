# Diagrams

This is where we store diagrams.
- To integrate diagrams.net into intellij and create/edit diagrams directly into the IDE,
simply add the diagrams.net plugin into intellij and it should appear as an option when creating a new file.
- Use png so that we could easily integrate it into any document if needs be.
